# Dynamic Web Pages with JavaScript

### Javascript is the behavior layer

_Javascript is like the wild wild west of languages_

- You will want to have your JavaScript code it its own JavaScript file with end ending extension as **.js**
- The `<script>` element is how you link a JavaScript file to an HTML file.

##### Objects and Methods

### Write comments to explain what your js code does.

### Data Types

- Numeric data type
- String data type
- Boolean data type

Variables can store numbers.
An array is a special type of variable that can store one or several values.
Boolean's can only clarify something as true or false.
