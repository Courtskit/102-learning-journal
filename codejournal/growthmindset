### Growth Mindset

**Growth mindset** contains such a powerful meaning. I love that every individual has the **ability** and **power** to accomplish whatever they set their mind to. Believing that you can is definitely a valuable first step towards any goal and speaking words of affirmation out into the atmosphere is powerful. Having the right mind set is _everything_.

### Reminders for myself

1. The hard tasks are what I'm going to grow the most from.
1. Remember not to compare yourself with others. You're new to this and on your _own path_.
1. Enjoy the process and the journey.
