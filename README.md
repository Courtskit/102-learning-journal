### Growth Mindset
  Growth mindset contains such a powerful meaning. I love that every individual has the **ability** and **power** to accomplish whatever they set their mind to. Beleiving that you can is definitly a great first step towards any goal and speaking words of affirmation out into the atmosphere is powerful. Having the right mindset is everthing.

#####  Reminders for myself
1. The hard tasks are what I'm going to grow the most from.
1. Remember not to compare yourself with others. You're new to this and on your *own path*.
1. Enjoy the process and the journey.
