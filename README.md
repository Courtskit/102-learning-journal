# Courtney's Learning Journal
## Code 102

### About Me
Hey! My name is Courtney and I am a student at Code Fellows, currently enrolled in the Code 102 course. I am new to coding and the technology field in general. This is my personal page to document my journey of learning code.

### Growth Mindset
  **Growth mindset** contains such a powerful meaning. I love that every individual has the **ability** and **power** to accomplish whatever they set their mind to. Believing that you can is definitely a valuable first step towards any goal and speaking words of affirmation out into the atmosphere is powerful. Having the right mind set is *everything*.  
###  Reminders for myself
1. The hard tasks are what I'm going to grow the most from.
1. Remember not to compare yourself with others. You're new to this and on your *own path*.
1. Enjoy the process and the journey.
